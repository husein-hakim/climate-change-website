    <h2>What is Climate? How is it different from Weather?</h2>
    <p>You may be aware of the current weather conditions. The variations we see and experience outside from day to day
        are referred to as weather. One day it may rain, and the next it may be bright. It becomes chilly at times. It
        may get rather heated at times. The weather varies from location to area as well. In one location, people may be
        wearing shorts and playing outside. People far away may be shovelling snow at the same moment.
        Climate refers to a location's typical weather. Seasonal climates can be rather diverse. In the summer, a
        location may be generally warm and dry. In the winter, the same location may be cold and damp. Climates differ
        depending on where you are. It's possible that you live somewhere where it snows all of the time. And other
        people live in climates where swimming is always possible outside.</p>

    <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
    <p>Earth’s climate has constantly been changing — even long before humans came into the picture. However, scientists
        have observed unusual changes recently. For example, Earth’s average temperature has been increasing much more
        quickly than they would expect over the past 150 years. Climate change is defined as a long-term shift in the
        average circumstances of a region, such as temperature and rainfall. The Earth's surface is warming, according
        to NASA scientists, and several of the warmest years on record have occurred in the last 20 years. The average
        long-term changes throughout the entire Earth are referred to as global climate change. Warming temperatures and
        variations in precipitation are examples, as are the impacts of global warming, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Rising sea levels</li>
        <li>Shrinking mountain glaciers</li>
        <li>Ice melting at a faster rate than usual in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic</li>
        <li>Changes in flower and plant blooming times.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The climate of the Earth has shifted over time. There have been seven cycles of glacial advance and retreat in
        the last 650,000 years, with the abrupt end of the last ice age marking the start of the current climatic era –
        and of human civilization. The majority of these climatic shifts are due to minute changes in Earth's orbit that
        alter the quantity of solar energy received by our planet.</p>

    <p>The current warming trend is noteworthy because the majority of it is highly likely (more than 95 percent
        likelihood) to be the consequence of human activities since the mid-twentieth century, and it is occurring at an
        unprecedented rate spanning millennia.
        Scientists have been able to view the big picture because to Earth-orbiting satellites and other technical
        developments, which have allowed them to collect a wide range of data on our planet and its climate on a global
        scale. The indications of a changing climate are shown in this corpus of data, which has been gathered over many
        years.
        Carbon dioxide and other gases' ability to trap heat was shown in the mid-nineteenth century. Many NASA sensors
        are based on their capacity to influence the passage of infrared light through the atmosphere. There is no doubt
        that rising quantities of greenhouse gases will cause the Earth to warm.
        Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers have all provided ice cores that show how the Earth's
        climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of
        sedimentary rocks all contain ancient evidence. The current pace of warming is about 10 times higher than the
        typical rate of ice-age recovery, according to this old, or paleoclimate, evidence. After the last Ice Age,
        carbon dioxide from human activities increased more than 250 times faster than it did from natural sources.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The "greenhouse effect"— warming that occurs when the atmosphere traps heat emanating from Earth toward space —
        has been expanding due to human growth since the mid-twentieth century, according to scientists.

        The presence of some gases in the atmosphere prevents heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain in the
        atmosphere semi-permanently and do not respond physically or chemically to temperature changes are referred to
        as "forcing" climate change. "Feedbacks" are gases, such as water vapour, that react physically or chemically to
        temperature changes.</p>
    <p>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</p>
    <img src="gases-that-contribute.jpg" class="img-fluid"
        alt="image showing the gases that cause climate change also known as greenhouse gases"
        style="width: 50%; margin-left: 24%">
    <ul>
        <li class="gases">Water vapor</li>
        <p class="gases-content">It is the most prevalent greenhouse gas, but it also serves as a climatic feedback. As
            the Earth's atmosphere warms, water vapour levels rise, but so do the chances of clouds and precipitation,
            making these two feedback processes crucial to the greenhouse effect.</p>

        <li class="gases">Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>)</li>
        <p class="gases-content">Carbon dioxide, a tiny but essential component of the atmosphere, is emitted by natural
            processes such as respiration and volcano eruptions, as well as by human activity such as deforestation,
            land use changes, and fossil fuel combustion. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution, humans have
            raised CO<sub>2</sub> levels in the atmosphere by 48%. The most important long-term "forcing" of climate
            change is
            this.</p>

        <li class="gases">Methane</li>
        <p class="gases-content">A hydrocarbon gas generated by both natural and human sources, such as waste
            decomposition in landfills, agriculture, and particularly rice cultivation, as well as ruminant digestion
            and manure management in domestic cattle. Methane is a considerably more active greenhouse gas than carbon
            dioxide molecule for molecule, but it is also far less prevalent in the atmosphere.</p>

        <li class="gases">Nitrous oxide</li>
        <p class="gases-content">Soil cultivation techniques, particularly the use of commercial and organic
            fertilisers, fossil fuel combustion, nitric acid generation, and biomass burning, all create a significant
            amount of this potent greenhouse gas.</p>

        <li class="gases">Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)</li>
        <p class="gases-content">Synthetic chemicals completely of industrial origin utilised in a variety of purposes,
            but now mainly controlled in manufacture and release to the atmosphere due to their ability to contribute to
            ozone layer depletion by international agreement. In addition, they are greenhouse gases.</p>
    </ul>

    <p>Human actions on Earth are altering the natural greenhouse. The combustion of fossil
        fuels such as coal and oil has raised the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere during the
        last
        century (CO<sub>2</sub>). This occurs because the combustion of coal or oil produces CO<sub>2</sub> by combining
        carbon in the
        air
        with oxygen. The clearing of land for agriculture, industry, and other human activities has raised
        greenhouse gas concentrations to a lesser amount.</p>

    <p>Scientists are confident that global temperatures will continue to increase for decades to come, owing in major
        part to greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity. Over 1,300 experts from the United States and other
        nations make up the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which predicts a temperature rise of 2.5
        to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p>The amount of climate change effects on specific regions will vary over time and with the ability of various
        societal and environmental systems to prevent or adapt to change, according to the IPCC.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p>Increases in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) over
        1990 levels, according to the IPCC, will have good effects in certain places and negative effects in others. As
        global temperatures rise, net yearly expenses will rise as well.</p>
    <!-- <br> -->
    <p>"The breadth of available data indicates that the net damage costs of climate change are expected to be
        considerable and to grow over time," the IPCC adds.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Since 1900, average precipitation in the United States has grown, although certain
                places have had higher increases than the national average, while others have seen declines. Over the
                next century, the northern United States will receive more winter and spring precipitation, while the
                Southwest will receive less.</p>

            <p class="card-text">Droughts in the Southwest and heat waves (periods of extremely hot weather lasting days
                to weeks) are expected to worsen, while cold waves are expected to become less severe.
                Summer temperatures are expected to continue to rise, and much of the western and central United States
                will experience a loss in soil moisture, which will intensify heat waves. What were once-in-a-decade
                severe heat days (one-day occurrences) are expected to occur every two or three years over much of the
                country by the end of this century.

            <p class="card-text">Since the early 1980s, the strength, frequency, and length of storms in the North
                Atlantic, as well as the frequency of the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased.
                Human and natural sources' respective contributions to these increases are yet unknown. As the climate
                continues to warm, hurricane-related storm strength and rainfall rates are expected to rise.</p>

            <h2>Sea Level Will Rise 1-8 feet by 2100</h2>
            <p class="card-text">Since accurate record keeping began in 1880, the global sea level has increased by
                roughly 8 inches. By 2100, it is expected to rise another 1 to 8 feet. This is due to the addition of
                water from melting land ice and the expansion of warm saltwater.

                Storm surges and high tides might combine with sea level rise and ground subsidence in the next decades
                to exacerbate floods in many areas. Because the seas take a long time to adapt to warmer temperatures at
                the Earth's surface, sea level rise will continue into 2100. As a result, ocean waters will continue to
                warm and sea levels will rise at rates comparable to or greater than those of the present century for
                many centuries.</p>

                <p>Global warming is mostly caused by carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases. While it is
                    impossible to stop climate change, it can be delayed.
                    We must achieve "net zero" carbon emissions by 2050 or sooner to prevent the worst effects of

                    fuel industries have cast doubt on global warming's reality. This deluge of misinformation confuses
                    and misleads the public about the rising dangers of global warming.</p>
